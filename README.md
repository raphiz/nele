# Nele - Awesome Newsletters with Python

Want to send a newsletter but mind big newsletter providers? Want to write your newsletters in Markdown and apply a fancy template on them? Moreover, want to do that from the command line?

Then Nele is the right choice for you!

## Feature Overview
* Create Beautiful emails - which look great in HTML and plaintext
* Personalize Emails with the power of Jinja Templates
* Create custom HTML layouts
* Write emails in Github-flavoured Markdown
* Use any SQLite database as backend (more backends open an issue)

Nele is not limited to Newsletters - it can also be used to send emails to all (or some) members of your community, group or society.

## Getting started
1. Change the directory to where you want to store your newsletters
```bash
cd newsletters/
```
2. Download the example configuration
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphiz/nele/master/example/nele.yml
```
3. Edit the configuration and adapt it to your needs - you must at least edit sender and source. Check out the [configuration](#Configuration) section for details.
```bash
vi nele.yaml
```

4. Time to create your template. In the example config, it is called `template.html`. You can also download an example template to get started.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphiz/nele/master/example/template.html
```

5. Create your first newsletter! To get started, you can use a template as well (or checkout the [configuration](#Configuration) section). This template defines an attachment. Delete the attachment section if you don't want it or download the example pdf as well.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphiz/nele/master/example/mail.md
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphiz/nele/master/example/demo.pdf
```

6. Ready to try it out? Test it before you send it to everyone using the draft method. The second parameter is the receiver

```bash
nele draft mail.md YOUR@EMAIL.com
```

7. Everything good? If so, you can easily send it to everyone.
```bash
nele send mail.md
```

## Limitations

* We currently only supported SQLite as a backend. Create an issue if you need something else
* The configuration file and frontmatter headers are not yet validated
* Newsletters should always provide a way to unsubscribe. Nele has no such functionality. You could for example mention in the footer, that users can unsubscribe by replying to this email.

## Configuration

### nele.yml

```yaml
email:
    # Relative path to the template to apply to you emails
    template: template.html

sender:
    # Your SMTP configuration
    host: smtp.example.com
    ssl: false
    starttls: true
    user: foo@example.com
    # This value will be set in the FROM header in the email
    sender: My Newsletter <foo@example.com>

source:
    # The backend - currently SQlite is the only choice
    provider: sqlite
    # Relative path from this file to the SQlite database
    url: db.sqlite
    # The query on the database to get all names and emails
    # Note that you *must* have a field called `email`
    query: SELECT * FROM users;

draft:
    # You can specify any key: value pairs here.
    # This is used when you run `nele draft` as an example record instead
    # of querying the database
    name: John
    custom_param: Foo
    email: baa@example.com
```

### Frontmatter header
On top of every markdown newsletter, you must provide the frontmatter header.

```yaml
---
# Subject is always required
subject: "[My Newsletter] (2016/1): Hello World."
# You can provide a list of attachments here (paths are relative  to THIS file)
attachments:
 - my.pdf
 - image.png
---
*Hello World*
This is a fancy email!
```
